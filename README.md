# The Definitive Top 5 *Legend of Zelda* Games

This is bound to ruffle some feathers.

## Honorable Mention: *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess* (2006)

Most people would agree this is a top-tier *Zelda* game. It has everything—great dungeons, great characters, riveting gameplay, unique atmosphere, and one of the most iconic final boss fights in video game history—but there's one major criticism that keeps it just out of the top 5: it's the *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* of the *Zelda* series.

*Twilight Princess* is a spiritual Successor to *Ocarina of Time*, so much so that it's damn near identical at times. Nintendo followed up on the backlash at [*Wind Waker*'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker) cartoony and vibrant art style with a gritty, realistic rehash of the series' most iconic game. While there's so much to love about this game, it plays it far too safe and can be quite derivative.

## 5. *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* (1991)

### Why it Belongs

You'd be hard pressed to find a top 5 list that this game *isn't* on. While it is a 2-D top-down game, it established the *Zelda* series as we would know it for the next 25 years. It introduced Link's most iconic weapon, the Master Sword, and a majority of the series' most iconic locations: Karariko Village, Lake Hylia, and Hyrule Castle, to name a few.

It was also the first Zelda game to include an actual driven narrative, establishing, once again, some of the series' most iconic characters and tropes.

### Why it Doesn't

While the visuals are endearing, they don't hold up as well as some other contemporary SNES games. On top of that, the game relies on what some call "trial-and-error" progression that requires players to seek or stumble upon hidden items to progress with no guidance. This works in a game like the original *Zelda* in 1986 but in a linear experience like this one, the exploration to find these items is more frustrating than it is rewarding.

## 4. *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* (2023)

### Why it Belongs

On paper, this is the game of the century (*Baldur's Gate 3* fans won't like that). It has,

* A vast open world with 3 different map levels, all seamlessly welded to create a nearly unmatched explorative experience,
* A cutting-edge physics system that allows the player to interact with the environment in almost any way they can imagine,
* A *fantastic* final boss fight,
* And innovative and addictive building mechanics that create awesome puzzles.

*Tears of the Kingdom* is the third instance in the series of a direct sequel, and it builds on what its predecessor did very nicely.

### Why it Doesn't

As much as I love this game for what it is, I hate it for everything it isn't. So, let me just list out the problems that keep it from topping the list:

* The Depths and Sky Islands are great concepts but lack any actual depth (pun intended). They're both amazing spectacles upon first contact but you quickly realize they're all copy-pasted and basically empty.
* Shrines. We didn't need them again. I will concede they were significantly better in this game than its predecessor, but I wanted to see fewer, deeper, and unique mini dungeons.
* The dungeons are just underwhelming. While I appreciate the attempt to get back to thematic dungeons, they pale in comparison to the depth of the dungeons in the other entries in the series (with the exception of one, but more on that later).
* Lack of meaningful rewards for exploration is a big problem. If I crawl through an admittedly well-designed cave system just to be rewarded with either a shrine or a chest containing a single hearty truffle, I'm gonna be upset.
* There's no meaningful differences in the overworld map between *Breath of the Wild* and *Tears of the Kingdom*. There's only one new settlement and many of the locations I was hoping to see again and how they evolved between the games remained completely unchanged.
* The story is just bad. The memory mechanic worked in *Breath of the Wild*. It does not work here. The first act of the game set up a grand epic tale that eventually just fell flat due to a complete lack of stakes.
* There's virtually nothing connecting it to the story of *Breath of the Wild*. Where did the Sheikah technology go? Why does no NPC remember Link even though he canonically has met them (and likely done quests for them) before?

Ultimately, *Tears of the Kingdom* fell under the weight of expectations. That said, it's placed on this list for a reason. I still played for 200 hours and enjoyed every second of it.

### 3. *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* (1998)

Oh boy, somebody's going to be very upset about this one.

### Why it Belongs

*Ocarina of Time* is the consensus best *Zelda* game for a reason. To this day it is the highest rated game of all time on metacritic, with a score of 99/100. It was the first 3-D game in the series and pioneered numerous mechanics that would not just become staples of the series, but gaming as a whole:

* The map design paved the way for 3-D open world adventure games.
* Created a target lock system that has become a necessity for 3-D close combat.
* Button mapping allowed for quick access to key items.

The story is grand, the characters are compelling, the world and history are rich, the music is revolutionary, and the atmosphere is engrossing. It's nearly everything you want in a game, but it unfortunately didn't age as well as some people would lead you to believe.

### Why it Doesn't

The controls can be so bad it borders on absurdity, some puzzles are repetitive and unintuitive, and a lack of fast travel makes trekking all the way across the map over and over again tedious. Time travel is also a core mechanic that is really only used in one instance at the end of the game (and for a few side quests). That's basically all I have to say. Fantastic game.

## 2. *The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask* (2000)

![Majora's Mask Moon](/images/majoras-maskjpg.jpg)

### Why it Belongs

This game has far and away the *best* narrative of the series (followed closely by [*Skyward Sword*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Skyward_Sword)). It's dark, it's personal, and the stakes are so high that they're *literally* staring at you from the sky.

The sidequests specifically are immaculate. Having to help and comfort people who are in denial that they're all about to die in a fiery apocalypse is so heart-wrenching, you can't not think about it for the rest of your life. Speaking of atmosphere, this game is so dark and so hopeless that it's hard to feel like the beacon of hope you're supposed to be, but god dammit you try anyway.

I can't forget to mention the mask and time travel mechanics. Complete brilliance.

## 1. *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*

### Why it Belongs

Okay, there's a bit of a nostalgia bias here. I didn't get into the *Zelda* series until 2011 when *Skyward Sword* released, so this was the first game in the series whose development cycle I followed from the beginning. That said, I can't deny the game that changed *Zelda* forever deserves the top spot regardless of nostalgia.

This is the most well-designed open world in history. Period. Every tree, every rock, every blade of grass is placed with intention. The climbing mechanic was something the gaming world had never seen before, the physics engine was revolutionary, and the characters were beyond endearing. Hyrule had never felt so alive.

A major criticism of the game I see often is that the world feels too empty. To people who believe that I say this: you're missing the entire point of the game. This is a post-apocalyptic world that the wilds have taken back. The silence, the stillness, and the serenity is the entire point. It's one of the only games I've played where I actively avoided using the fast travel mechanic as much as possible.

You might be wondering why I have this as the top game and not *Tears of the Kingdom* despite the latter doing nearly everything better. That's because the one thing *Breath of the Wild* does better makes all the difference: cohesion.

*Tears of the Kingdom* feels like a mad scientist got their hands on *Breath of the Wild* and went insane. In *Breath of the Wild*, the emptiness feels intentional. In *Tears of the Kingdom*, the emptiness feels like an oversight. Many of the flaws in *Tears of the Kingdom* were strengths in *Breath of the Wild* simply because it all felt like it had intention behind it.

The story, while not super engaging, had great character and was really fun to uncover through the memories.

But of course, no game is perfect.

### Why it Doesn't

Oddly enough, the criticisms of *Tears of the Kingdom* are virtually the same as they are here (which is even worse for *Tears of the Kingdom* since it did very little, or straight up nothing, to address those criticisms and exacerbated them). To rehash:

* Lack of meaningful rewards for exploration.
* Shrines that felt repetitve, though not as bad here since is was the first attempt at creating something like this.
* Underwhelming dungeons.
* Lack of enemy variety.
* Too many fetch quests.

## Final Thoughts

If you disagree with my list, you:

1. Are a human being with your own opinions.
2. I don't have anything else, I just needed to add an ordered list.

That's all, goodbye.
